    <h2>[Preston Jobes]</h2>
    <P>I was born in Provo, Utah on October 1st, 2002, I grew up in Las Vegas, Nevada and am really excited to be at this school.</P>
    <p>i am 19 years old, and my major is Computer Science. I like to tinker around with electronics, and now im trying to get into coding.I would say that i like long walks on the beach, but that seems a bit ambiguous.</p>
    <p>I feel like I will succeed in this class if I put the effort into actually doing the work, and spending time to learn python, and VS Code.</p>
